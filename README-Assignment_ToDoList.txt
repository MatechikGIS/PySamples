This file is a submission for a homework assignment for an Intro to Python class during the summer semester of 2022.

I had to create a  Python program that could organize a To Do list and perform the following tasks:

1. Show all To Do items on list
2. Show all outstanding To Do items on list
3. Create new To Do items
4. Edit existing To Do items
5. Remove existing To Do items
6. Mark a To Do as complete
7. Exit the program
